<b>CodeAcademy JavaScript Project: Magic Eight Ball</b>
<p>(From the course: Learn JavaScript)</p>

<p>Description: <br>
Youâ€™ve learned a powerful tool in JavaScript: control flow! Itâ€™s so powerful, in fact, that it can be used to tell someoneâ€™s fortune.
In this project we will build a Magic Eight Ball using control flow in JavaScript.
The user will be able to input a question, then our program will output a random fortune.
